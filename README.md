## About The Project

For more than 25 years, I have been working professionally and privately under Windows and Linux. Since I switched to a Mac for private use, I find it increasingly difficult to work efficiently with the keyboard layout and the hotkeys.

Not only that I had to google how to type an "@" symbol in the first minute as a fresh Mac owner to log in to the system, no. I also had to realize that everyday and over years rehearsed actions just don't work under Mac...

However, this challenge can be mastered relatively easily with a few settings and the additional program: "Karabiner Elements".

So if you:
- have difficulties to get used to the Mac Layout?
- often have to switch between Windows/Linux and Mac?
- just don't want to miss familiar gestures like CTRL+C/V and many more?

## Features
Since we've changed the general Keyboard-Layout of MacOS to use a Windows Keyboard Layout, our symbol keys like "@, {}, [], ()" are now where they belong. But we also want to use the Windows Hotkeys like CTRL+C/V instead of CMD+C/V etc. so additionally we need to flip some keys with "simple Modifications".

| Switch from | to | so that the key... |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `grave_accent_and_tilde` | `non_us_backslash` | under ESC becomes (^, Â°)  |
| `non_us_backslash` | `grave_accent_and_tilde` | next to LShift becomes (<, >, \|) |
| `left_command` | `left_control` | works for Copy & Paste etc. |
| `left_control` | `left_command` | works for Alt+Tab etc.|
| `right_command` | `left_option` | works as AltGR under Windows (for @, â‚¬, {, [, \, ], }, etc.) |

<br/>

You may observed that we (except AltGR) modified only the keys for the left hand side, this is because we want the keybinding to work not only on an external keyboard but also on the MacBook's keyboard.

In order to use some windows hotkeys, we need to use the "complex Modifications" of Karabiner Elements.

| Hotkey (Windows Keyboard perspective) | Description 
| --- | --- |
| `LEFT_ALT + Tab` | opens "alt+tab" Tasklist 
| `LEFT_CTRL + Tab` | restores CTRL+Tab due to the LEFT_ALT+Tab switch 
| `LEFT_ALT + Q` | replaces CMD+Q with ALT+Q 
| `LEFT_CTRL + Backspace` | delete whole words 
| `LEFT_CTRL + ArrowLeft` | jumps to the beginning of the previews word
| `LEFT_CTRL + ArrowRight` | jumps to the beginning of the next word
| `LEFT_CTRL + Shift + ArrowLeft` | selects the previous word
| `LEFT_CTRL + Shift + ArrowRight` | selects the next word
| `LEFT_CTRL + LEFT_ALT + ENTF` | opens Activity Monitor (Task Manager) 
| `WIN(Left_Option) + R` | opens Terminal (run) 
| `WIN(Left_Option) + Tab` | opens Mission Control (windows expose) 
| `F5` | Refresh Website

## Known issues (FAQ)

  ### No Windows-Layout in the Keyboard-Settings (other)
  If you don't see the "Windows Keyboard, LANG" in the Keyboard-Settings, even though you put the "win-germany.keylayout"-file into place, you need to restart your Mac. (I don't know why, but it works)

  <br>

  ### ( ~ becomes Â± ) and ( | becomes â‰¤ )
  Occasionally it switches the keyboard layout back to the default one. (You can verify the switch easily since the info icon switches back to the [ A ] instead of the keyboard symbol) If this happens, just switch it back to the Keyboard-Entry and it will work again.

  FYI; It's a hotkey on mac or something, until I find out what it is, I'll just leave it here.
